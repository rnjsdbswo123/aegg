                    <h3>Jeju Fresh Eggs</h3>
                    <p>Our eggs are supplied from welfare-friendly farms where chickens belonging to 'Aewol Papas' freely roam in the playground.
                    <br><br>
                    The farm raises healthy hens and roosters together,
                    allowing them to naturally produce
                    fresh welfare-friendly eggs.
                    <br><br>
                    Experience the freshness and quality of
                    our welfare-friendly eggs.

                    <p>We, Aewolpapas, raise 'GueomDak', a native chicken that only grows in Jeju.
                    <br><br>
                    Commonly called 'flying chicken', Gueomdak is small in size, but has wider wings than ordinary chickens.
                    <br><br>
                    Due to its small size, Gueomdak has a good texture and a deep taste.

                    For better and chewy texture, the boiled chicken

                    For this reason, some fine bones may come out.
